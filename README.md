🎓 Student Performance Prediction - ML Project
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the key factors influencing student academic performance using various classification models.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used includes students from multiple nationalities and grade levels, along with several determining features such as:

Number of hands raised

Number of attendances

Number of hours studied

Visits to resources

Participation in discussions

Announcement views

The data is provided in CSV format.

🧠 Objective
To identify and analyze the factors that most significantly impact student grades using supervised machine learning models.

🛠️ ML Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained and evaluated to determine the most effective in terms of prediction accuracy.

📊 Visualizations
The project includes:

Correlation heatmaps

Accuracy comparison graphs

Confusion matrices

Other visual aids to interpret results and model performance

✅ Results
The models help reveal which student behavior factors (like class participation or resource usage) are most predictive of academic performance.
